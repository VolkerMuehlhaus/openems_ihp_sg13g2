# Model comments
#
# This is a generic model running port excitation for all ports defined below,
# to get full [S] matrix data.
# Output is stored to Touchstone S-parameter file.
# No data plots are created by this script.
#
# This model uses the settings{} dictionary syntax and the gds2openEMS PyPI package
# (pip install gds2openEMS) instead of a local copy of the modules folder - see the
# README for the loose-variable / local-modules-copy alternative, still fully supported.
